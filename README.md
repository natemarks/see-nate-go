# see-nate-go

This is a step-by-step adventure in go.  The purpose is to really etch this stuff in my mind adn maybe share something useful.  I'm, gointo try to do one little new thing in each commit so the commit log should be a good reflection of my progress.  

I'll start with  my environment setup for Ubuntu using vscode.  You'll need git installed and you can use this shell script to set up your go workspace based on the best practices as I understood them:

If you have problems with the setup, file an issue and I'll try to help, but I'm trying to avoid getting bogged down in pltform-specific stuff.

prerequisites:
 - install git and wget
 - run the setup script
 - install vscode and the goland extension



Create a .gitignore and a README.md
